## Technical Background: How DrugBot Works
Behind DrugBot's intuitive interface lies a sophisticated technical framework designed to deliver accurate and timely responses to user queries. Here's how it works:
- <b>Functionality:</b> DrugBot utilizes advanced scraping techniques to gather information from reputable sources such as [drugs.com](http://drugs.com/). When a user submits a query, DrugBot searches for relevant details on the specified medicine or medical condition, extracting data from the first available source.
- <b>Integration:</b> Leveraging OpenAI Function Calling, DrugBot seamlessly integrates with external APIs to fetch and process information. This integration enables DrugBot to deliver comprehensive responses tailored to the user's query.
- <b>Response Generation:</b> Once the relevant data is scraped, DrugBot passes it to another function responsible for generating user-friendly responses. By utilizing OpenAI's completion API, DrugBot formulates concise and informative answers based on the extracted context, ensuring that users receive actionable insights.
    
### Understanding the Chatbot Workflow
    
<img src="media_files/get-a-comprehensive-guide-to-medication-with-drug-assistant/flow.png" alt="Chatbot Workflow" width="700" height="250" />
    
    
    
#### Explanation
- When a User inputs a message into the chatbot, the message undergoes processing through an <b>`OpenAI Function Calling`</b> method. This method initially assesses whether the input message pertains to medicine, a medical condition, or drugs. If the message does not align with these topics, the bot promptly responds, encouraging the user to ask a relevant question. 
Conversely, if the message is relevant, the method triggers a function call to extract details such as medicine names, medical conditions, or drug names from the user's query. These extracted parameters are then passed to a function called <b>`get_drug_info`</b>, which essentially serves as a web scraping script.
    
    
- Within the <b>`get_drug_info`</b> function, we utilize BeautifulSoup to scrape content from [drugs.com](http://drugs.com/), retrieving comprehensive details about the queried drug or medicine. Subsequently, we assess the token length of the scraped information. Given that we're utilizing <b>`gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`</b>, with a token capacity of 32K, we ensure that the token limit remains under 30K. If the token limit meets this criterion, we proceed to send both the scraped content and the user's query to OpenAI Completion API. OpenAI then formulates a tailored response based on the provided context, which is relayed back to the user via the frontend as the bot's response. 
    
    
- However, if the token length of the scraped content exceeds 30K, we encounter a token exceeding error. To address this issue, we adopt a strategy of selectively passing segments of the content whose combined tokens remain under 30K. Yet, determining which segments to pass presents a challenge. Simply selecting from the beginning up to 30K tokens risks omitting crucial information, potentially leading to incomplete responses from OpenAI.
    
    
- To circumvent this, we implement semantic search within the scraped content using a similarity search approach. Initially, we divide the text into smaller chunks, each containing fewer than 512 tokens, in consideration of the token limit imposed by the embedding model. Next, we generate embeddings for each chunk and compute the embeddings for the user's query. Subsequently, we calculate the similarity score between the user's query and each chunk, sorting the chunks in descending order based on their scores.
    
    
- Proceeding iteratively, we construct a new context by combining the sorted chunks until the token limit is reached. This iterative approach ensures that relevant information is preserved, mitigating the risk of overlooking pertinent details. Finally, we send this refined context along with the user's query to OpenAI for completion. The response generated by OpenAI is then tailored and presented to the user, ensuring a comprehensive and relevant interaction.

#### DrugInfoHelper

This Jupyter notebook cell defines a Python class `DrugInfoHelper`, which encapsulates various functionalities related to retrieving drug information and running conversations. Key features include:

- Initialization with API key, client, model details, and other parameters.


- Method `get_drug_info` to retrieve medication details from `drugs.com` based on provided details.
    - It takes medication_details as input, which represents the query for medication information.
    - The function splits the medication details into a list and removes any leading or trailing whitespace.
    - For each medication in the list, the function attempts to fetch data from the drugs.com website using HTTP requests. 
    - It uses BeautifulSoup library for scraping the content. It extracts the detail from the first most link from the HTTP response.
    - Upon successful retrieval, it extracts the medication details from the HTML response and appends it to the medicine_detail variable.
    - Finally, the function returns the accumulated medication details after logging the length of the extracted information.
    


- Method `run_conversation` to execute a conversation with the OpenAI Chat API, enabling automated responses and function execution based on the input message. This method basically utilizes OpenaAI Function Calling technique to run the `get_drug_info` function based on user's message.
    - Parses the input message to identify any function calls within it.
    - Constructs a list of functions to be considered during the conversation, including their names, descriptions, and parameters.
    - Sends the input message along with the list of functions to the OpenAI chat completion API.
    - Extracts the response from the API, which includes any generated content and information about function calls.
    - Checks if a function call is present in the response message.
    - If a function call is detected, matches the function name to its corresponding function in the codebase.
    - Invokes the identified function with the provided arguments extracted from the API response.
    - Sets a flag indicating whether a direct response from the API or a function response is returned.
    - Returns either the function response or the content directly from the API response, based on the presence of a function call..


- Utility methods like `clean_text` for removing HTML tags, `check_content_tokens` for verifying token limits, and others for text manipulation and analysis.


- Functions for creating sections, generating overlap, updating embeddings, and calculating cosine similarity.
    - `create_sections` to split the given text into smaller chunks. So that embeddings can be created for each chunk. Limits the chunk length to `512` due to the embedding model's limit.
    - `create_overlap` to create overlapping sections from a list of sections for enhanced context. It creates overlapped section inorder to avoid loss of information.
    - We employ `NumPy` arrays and list comprehensions during embedding creation, storage, and sections creation and overlappings, opting for them over Pandas or dataframe structures to enhance speed through the utilization of NumPy's efficient numerical computations.
    - `update_embeddings` to update embeddings for a list of sections using an embedding model.
    - `get_embedding` to obtain the embedding for a given text using an embedding model.
        - The embedding model utilized is `gte-tiny`. [TaylorAI/gte-tiny](https://huggingface.co/TaylorAI/gte-tiny) stands as an open-sourced embedding model. Preceding its selection, various other models underwent testing. Following careful comparison encompassing factors such as latency, model size, and accuracy, this model emerged as the optimal choice.

        </div>
    - `cosine_similarity` to calculate the cosine similarity between two embeddings.


- Method `prepare_prompt` for building prompts with retrieved contexts included. The `prepare_prompt` function constructs a complete prompt for the OpenAI chat model by combining the user's question with relevant context sections retrieved from previous interactions. This prompt is then used to generate a response from the model.
    - Calculate the tokens consumed by the system prompt and user's question.
    - Determine the number of tokens available for context sections by subtracting the consumed tokens from the total token limit.
    - Iterate over the context sections, adding them to the prompt until the token limit for context is reached.
    - Join the selected context sections into a single string.
    - Construct the complete prompt by combining the user's question, system prompt, and selected context sections.


- Method `answer` to generate a response from the OpenAI chat model based on the provided messages, such as user queries and contextual information. It utilizes the model to produce a response tailored to the input.

#### DrugInfoAssistant

This Jupyter notebook cell defines a Python class `DrugInfoAssistant`, which serves as an assistant for retrieving drug information and generating responses based on user input. Key functionalities include:

- Initialization with attributes such as system prompt, text, dataframe, sections, and helper class instance.
- Method `preprocessing` for preprocessing input messages, including running conversations using the `DrugInfoHelper`, cleaning text, creating sections, generating overlap, and updating embeddings.
- Method `generate_response` to generate responses based on user input, which involves preprocessing the input, checking content token limits, generating embeddings for the user's message, calculating similarities, sorting sections based on similarity scores, preparing prompts for the final answer, and generating the answer itself.

The assistant integrates extensively with the `DrugInfoHelper` class for various text processing and retrieval tasks, including logging, error handling, and integration with external APIs for drug information retrieval.

#### DrugBot
Initializes the class `DrugBot` that serves as a model for text generation. 
This class represents a text generation model implemented for deployment using Kserve. It integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, facilitates text generation based on received prompts, and manages audio generation if required. It utilizes various external services such as OpenAI for text generation, Sentence Transformer for embedding model.

Overall Functionality:
The KserveTextGeneration class initializes the model, loads necessary configurations, handles incoming requests for text generation, manages limitations on input size and usage, generates text responses using GPT-3.5, and provides functionalities for audio generation if requested.



Key components and functionalities of this class include:

- `Initialization`: The class initializes various attributes including model name, API keys, configuration parameters, and logger settings.

- `load` method: This method is responsible for loading the embedding model required for text processing. It utilizes the `SentenceTransformer` class to load the model from the specified directory.


- `ready_response` method: This method returns a predefined ready response in case of errors during initialization.


- `get_completion_from_messages` method: An asynchronous method that interacts with the OpenAI API to generate completions based on input messages. It configures parameters such as the model, temperature, max tokens, and stream for the completion request. Additionally, it utilizes exponential backoff for retrying in case of failures. 


- `predict` method: The `predict` method handles the prediction process for text generation based on the received payload. It processes the input payload, checks for input limitations, manages usage limits, generates text responses using GPT-3.5, handles audio generation if requested, and returns the generated response. The method logs various steps of the prediction process, including input processing, content generation, and any encountered errors.


These methods in `DrugBot` class encapsulates the functionality required for text generation, including initialization, model loading, request handling, response generation, audio conversion and error handling. It provides a comprehensive solution for serving text generation capabilities via an API endpoint. They are designed to operate seamlessly in a production environment, ensuring efficient and reliable text generation services.
