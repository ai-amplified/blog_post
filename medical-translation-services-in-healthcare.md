**Medical document translation** plays a crucial role in the dissemination of health-related information globally. Health professionals and researchers continually advance their understanding, developing new treatments and medicines. The ongoing study of health relies on the swift and accurate translation of information, allowing researchers from diverse regions to access up-to-date knowledge efficiently. The process of medical document translation ensures that this vital information is conveyed accurately in various languages, facilitating seamless collaboration and knowledge exchange in the field of healthcare.

**Medical translation** is different from general translation and the accurate translation of documents such as clinical findings, patient files, research papers, and treatment guidelines plays a critical role in international medical communication. Medical translation involves not only word-for-word translation but also medical terminology, cultural differences, and disease-specific language structures. As such, it requires expertise and rigor.

**Medical machine translation models** are artificial intelligence-based systems developed to overcome these challenges. These models have the ability to translate medical documents quickly, accurately, and faithfully to specialized details between various languages. As Aimped, we have carried out meticulous work on preparing medical translation artificial intelligence models. We worked meticulously at every stage such as collecting and preparing the data and determining the architecture to be used for model training.

<h2>Training Data Curation:</h2> In our efforts to compile scientific publications in the field of medicine and establish accurate source and target language pairs, we employed both statistical and AI-based methods to achieve the most precise translations. Beyond basic statistical techniques—such as counting characters and words, and analyzing their ratios—we applied numerous advanced methods to ensure the highest similarity between sentences in the source and target languages.

In addition to leveraging these methods, we integrated the expertise of human translators who produced high-quality translation pairs. Furthermore, we utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data, enriching our dataset with additional translation pairs.

To further enhance accuracy, we utilized transformer architectures to generate vectors that encapsulate the meaning of each sentence pair. We then measured the semantic similarity of these pairs using the cosine similarity method. Our results were filtered based on threshold values specifically tailored to each language pair's characteristics.

<h2>Selection of the train algorithm:</h2> We benefited from transformers architectures to train the models. Among these architectures, we decided that as a result of the tests and researches we made on the architecture of <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/marian">Marian MT</a>, it is a more ideal structure to train the medical translation model.


<h2>Training the models:</h2> The process of training the models is based on a number of experiments such as training et-test et-evaluation and then updating the training arguments according to the results obtained. In addition, according to the evaluation results, we realized that each language pair showed different features. The threshold values we set in the data preparation process and used to filter the data were also models we updated and re-prepared the data.
After the training and data preparation cycle, we decided the final training parameters and trained the final models. In the table below, you can see the scores obtained by the medical translation models.

**Use areas of Medical Translation models:**

- **Medical translation experts using medical translation models:**
  
    - **Terminology Formation:** It can help to translate specific terms. It can be used to obtain information about new or specific terms.

    - **Rapid Translation Transactions:** In case of emergency situations or in case of requires speed, medical translation specialists can use these models to make a fast and basic translation. This can enable them to gain time and provide a general understanding immediately.

    - **Document Analysis:** It can be used to analyze a large amount of documents quickly. This may be useful to create a summary or to identify similarities and differences between documents.

- **Medical Faculty Students:** Medical students can translate medical resources written in various languages in accordance with the medical literature using medical translation models quickly and accurately. In this way, they can gain a wider perspective about global medicine literature and practice.

- **Academicians:** Healthcare professionals who make an academic career can improve their knowledge by examining medical research published in various sources by exceeding the language barrier. Medical translation models help academicians to overcome the problem of language in the process of understanding and learning publications and research in the field of medicine and to improve their research and increase their knowledge and experience.

- **Doctors and Health Professionals:** Physicians can examine global clinical findings and developments in cases such as pandemic epidemics rapidly over the language barrier thanks to the ability of medical translation models to translate into the medical literature. In addition, they can use medical translation models in their routine work such as new treatment methods, information about medications or disease symptoms.

- **Pharmaceutical and Drug Research Companies:** Pharmaceutical companies can translate written materials such as research, thesis, article specific to the biomedical field using the medical translation model.

**Limitations:** Our translation model has been meticulously designed and extensively trained to cater specifically to the demanding needs of the Healthcare and Biomedical domain. While it excels within this highly specialized realm, it's important to note that if you opt to employ the model in domains outside of healthcare, its performance may not meet the exceptional standards characteristic of the medical field. We advise a thoughtful consideration of this limitation when contemplating the model's application.
